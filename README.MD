# Advent Coding Challenges 2025 (Corsair Employees)
The goal is to solve a problem each day using your language and/or framework of your choice.

# Rules
1) You must be an employee of Corsair or a subsidiary to participate.
2) All code must be original in the context of the task. If you use AI to solve the issue then you MUST include the prompt(s) used as well as the model it was run against (ie: gtp-5...).
3) Dependencies are allowed but must be defined in the root of each days solution.
